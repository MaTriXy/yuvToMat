# YuvToMat
### YUV_420_888 Image to OpenCV RGB Mat Conversion
High-performance library for converting YUV_420_888 images from Android's Camera v2 API to OpenCV Mats. The resulting Mat contains RGB pixels.
  
## Usage
### Kotlin
Simply use the extension function on android.media.Image.  

```kotlin
val mat = image.rgb()
```

### Java
Simply use the static function ```Yuv.toMat```

```java
Mat mat = Yuv.toMat(image)
```

### Clipping the image
This library supports efficient clipping of the image before converting. 
Just pass a clip to the function:

```kotlin
val mat = image.mat(Clip(left=20, top=20, right=40, bottom=40))
```
